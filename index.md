This website is to gather documentation and details for Mozilla's experimental
product: [Firefox Lockbox][website]. Firefox Lockbox will be the framework for
us to test and quickly iterate on hypotheses (on desktop and mobile).

All planning and work performed is reflected on our Waffle.io kanban board:  
[https://waffle.io/mozilla-lockbox/lockbox-extension][waffle]

Learn more about the Lockbox [project processes](/process.md).
